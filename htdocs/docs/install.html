    <h3 id="install-package">Installing on packaged systems</h3>
    
    <p>The easiest way to install released versions of the Markup Validator is to use the packages created
    for some platforms by contributors: Mac OS X, openSUSE/SUSE Linux, Debian GNU/Linux and Fedora/Red Hat packages are 
    <a href="../source/">available</a>.</p>


    <h3 id="otherguides">This guide, and other guides</h3>    
    <h4>Other installation guides</h4>
    <p>The installation guide we provide here is a rather generic set of instructions, 
    which should work on most systems. To our knowledge, the following platform-specific 
    guides are also available and can be of interest :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/validator.html">Mac OS X and OS X Server</a>
        at the Apple Developer Connection,</li>
        <li><a href="install_win.html">Windows</a>, by David Tibbe</li>
        <li><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2003Dec/0023.html">Linux (Slackware)</a>
        by Nick Talbott</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Related documentation</h4>
    <p>This installation guides presumes knowledge of the <a href="../source/">Source availability</a> for the
    Markup Validator.</p>
    <p>We recommend that <a href="devel.html">developers</a> wishing to contribute on the Markup Validator or modify it
    go through this installation procedure once, to get familiar with the system.</p>

    
    <h3 id="install-fromsource">Installing from source (generic case)</h3>
    <p>These instructions are strongly inspired from Nick Talbott's guide for Slackware Linux. Thanks Nick!</p>

	<p>The installation guide assumes that you have a working Web server. We suggest
    the popular Apache server, which is used for the W3C Markup Validation service. 
    The validator may work with other Web servers than the popular Apache, but
    we can not guarantee that it will. You will also need a working installation 
    of the Perl language (standard on most Web servers).</p>

    <h4 id="install-prereq">Step 0: Prerequisites</h4>
    <p>
       Apart from a properly configured Web server, the Validator needs a
       SGML parser -- that does all the hard work --, Perl (version 5.8.0
       or newer) and several Perl modules used by the "check" CGI script. 
     </p>
	<p>
	   The following few steps will guide you through installing those 
	   prerequisites, and then the validator itself</p>
    
    <h4 id="install-prereq-sp">Step 1: install OpenSP, the SGML (and XML) parser</h4>
     <p>
       The SGML parser we're currently using is <code>OpenSP 1.5.2</code>,
       which can be found on the
       <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openjade/">OpenJade home page</a>.
       Note that the validator will not work with any version of OpenSP earlier than 1.5.2.
     </p>
	 <p>If you install opensp from source, make sure to enable HTTP retrieval of DTDs.
		Disabling the building of documentation </p>
	 <p>Run the following as root/administrator, or under sudo</p>
	 <pre>
[unpack opensp]
./configure --enable-http --disable-doc-build
make
make install
</pre>

      <h4  id="install-prereq-perl">Step 2: install required Perl Modules</h4>
	  <h5>Quick and Easy: install the CPAN bundle</h5>
     <p>
       One easy - and strongly recommended - way to take care of all these
       Perl module dependencies is to install
       <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bundle-W3C-Validator/">Bundle-W3C-Validator</a>
       from CPAN.  See the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bundle-W3C-Validator/lib/Bundle/W3C/Validator.pm">documentation included with it</a>
       for more details.
     </p>
	<p>Run the following as root/administrator, or under sudo</p>
	<pre>
perl -MCPAN -e shell
[cpan shell starts, you may need to answer configuration questions]
install Bundle::W3C::Validator
</pre>

     <h5>For reference: List of required Perl module distributions</h5>
     <p><strong>You may skip this if you have successfully installed the bundle above</strong>.</p>

	 <p>Below are the Perl modules required to run the Markup Validator. This list is informative, 
	 you do not need to install them individually if you follow the <a href="#install-prereq-perl">CPAN instructions</a>

          version.  Validator's support for compressed responses is announced
          using the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> HTTP header with version 5.816
          and later, depending on if the modules required for libwww-perl's

     <h6>For reference: List of optional Perl module distributions</h6>

      <p>

    <h4 id="install-download">Step 3: Download the validator and DTDs</h4>
        <p>Download the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/validator.tar.gz">Validator's Tar Ball</a>
        and the sgml-lib <a href="http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib.tar.gz">DTD library</a> from our site.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, if you want to work on the latest development version, you can download 
        both from our Mercurial repository, but you should be aware that this version may not work at all.</p>
        <p>(<a href="../source/">Read more</a> about retrieving the source)</p>


    <h4 id="install-components">Step 4: Unpack the validator</h4>
        <ol>                
            <li><p>Create a directory for the validator's installation. On Unix-based systems, 
            we suggest to use the default folder <code>/usr/local/validator</code>. This
            directory will be referred to as <code>[validatorpath]</code>
            throughout this guide.</p></li>
     
            <li>
              <p>
                Unpack the two archives of the validator and sgml-lib into a
                temporary directory, and copy the directories
                <code>htdocs</code>, <code>httpd/cgi-bin</code>, and
                <code>share</code> from <code>validator-<em>X.Y</em></code>
                into <code>[validatorpath]</code>.
              </p>
<pre>
# tar zxvf validator.tar.gz 
# tar zxvf sgml-lib.tar.gz 
# mkdir /usr/local/validator
# cd validator-<em>X.Y</em>
# mv htdocs share httpd/cgi-bin /usr/local/validator
</pre>
              <p>
                The <code>[validatorpath]</code> directory should now have
                subdirectories named <code>cgi-bin</code>, <code>htdocs</code>,
                and and <code>share</code>.
              </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

    <h4 id="install-configure">Step 5: Configure the Validator</h4>
	    <ol>
	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Create the directory <code>/etc/w3c</code> and copy all the files
	            from <code>[validatorpath]/htdocs/config/</code> to it. You may keep 
				the configuration files in place, but would have to modify the Web 
				Server's environment variables to point to the configuration directory.
				As this may be tedious, we recommend using <code>/etc/w3c</code>.
	          </p>
	        </li>
	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Edit <code>/etc/w3c/validator.conf</code> to reflect where files
	            are in your installation, and configure other parameters there as
	            you wish.  This file is well commented and modifying it should be
	            relatively straightforward.
			   </p><p>In general you will only need to check 
			    that the Base path is set to where you have unpacked the validator
			    files. If you have used <code>/usr/local/validator</code> you do not need
				to change anything
	          </p>
<pre>
Base = /usr/local/validator
</pre>
			<p>If you plan to validate documents on a private network, you will need to enable 
				the following option in the <code>validator.conf</code> file:</p>
<pre>
Allow Private IPs = yes
</pre>

	        </li>
	        <li><p>If you want to check documents with the (external and experimental) HTML5 conformance 
	            checker, you may want to <a href="http://about.validator.nu/">install the validator.nu</a>
	            engine and enable it with the following in your validator.conf file:</p>
<pre>
&lt;External&gt;
## Enable checking documents via external services
HTML5 = http://localhost:8888/html5/   
&lt;/External&gt;    
</pre></li>
			<li><p>You may now test the validator script, before plugging it into the Web Server:</p>
<pre>
# cd /usr/local/validator/
# cd cgi-bin/
# ./check uri=http://www.w3.org/
…
</pre>
<p>The script should output the raw HTML results of validation. If this does not work, double-check that 
	you have properly followed all the steps so far.</p>
</li>
	    </ol>
	     <h5>For reference: list of configuration files</h5>
	     <p><strong>You may skip this, unless you plan to modify the validator's default behavior.</strong>.</p>
			  <dl>
		        <dt>validator.conf</dt>
		        <dd>
		          The validator's <strong>main configuration file</strong>. This will
		          generally be the only file you need to edit. It sets various parameters, such as:
		          the address of the maintainer, various file paths and locations,
		          whether the <a href="api.html">API</a> is enabled, etc.
		        </dd>
		        <dt>charset.cfg</dt>
		        <dd>

		        </dd>
		       </dl>


	<h4 id="configure-apache">Step 6: Configure the Web server</h4>
	<p>The following instructions are for the Apache Web server, and should be adapted 
	if you plan on using another server.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
              <p>If you are using the Apache server, you may use the validator under mod_perl2. This should happen automatically if you are using the httpd.conf snippet distributed with the validator or something similar, and your Apache server has mod_perl2 installed and enabled. Using mod_perl2 will bring important performance benefits, but has not been tested extensively. If you are successfully running the validator under mod_perl, or run into issues doing so, <a href="../feedback.html">contact us</a>.</p>
              
              <p>Also worth enabling within Apache is mod_expires, which will allow caching of the validator's static documents, stylesheets, and images.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Edit the configuration of your Web server to refer to the
                specific configuration file for the validator.
              </p>
              <p>
                This can be done by inserting the contents of the
                <code>httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code> file (from where you
                unpacked the validator's tarball above) in your
                <code>httpd.conf</code>, or by copying the file somewhere
                and including it like:
              </p>
              <pre>Include /where/you/copied/it/httpd.conf</pre>
              <p>
                Then, start editing the validator specific part.
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li><p>You may want to set up a "virtual server" for the service. This can be done
            by adding something similar to the following :</p>
<pre>&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1&gt;                                                               
	DocumentRoot [validatorpath]/htdocs/                        
	ServerName validator.example.org
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>
            <p><strong>AND/OR</strong> you may want to have the service at a specific location
            on your Web server, which can be configured as follows :</p>
            <pre>Alias /validator/ [validatorpath]/htdocs/</pre>
            </li>
                
            <li><p>Configure environment variables affective validator's outside connectivity
            if needed (such as <code>http_proxy</code>), see examples in the supplied <code>httpd.conf</code>
            and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl/lib/LWP.pm#ENVIRONMENT">LWP</a>
            and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/libnet/Net/FTP.pm#CONSTRUCTOR">Net::FTP</a>
            documentation.</p></li>

            <li><p>Finish editing this HTTP server configuration file, adapting 
            all the directory references to reflect the paths used in your installation.</p></li>
                
            <li><p>Now restart the Web server to activate the updated configuration.</p><p> For Apache
            this is done by typing into a shell, as System Administrator: 
            <code>apachectl graceful</code> (or, for older versions of Apache 
            <code>apachectl configtest</code> then <code>apachectl restart</code>)</p></li>
       </ol>

    <h4 id="install-check">Step 7: Check the installation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Point your browser at the new site.</p></li> 
        <li><p>Check the error log of the Web server to get clues on what may be wrong 
        if you get any server errors.</p></li>

   <h3 id="install-troubleshoot">Troubleshooting a new installation</h3>
   <p>It is not always easy to troubleshoot an incomplete, or failed, installation of
   the Markup Validator. While the instructions given in this page should help most people
   install the validator successfully on their system, bad luck, a forgotten step 
    or a broken component can make things go sour.</p>

   <h4>Double check the installation steps</h4>
   <p>The first sound thing to do if the installation failed would be to check that you did not forget
   any step while installing. properly copying and editing the configuration file is among the common
   mistakes, for example.</p>

   <h4>Check the logs</h4>
   <p>The error logs for your Web server should be a good first place to look for hints on what
   is wrong with your installation.</p>

   <h4>Check the dependencies</h4>
   <p>A common problem with a newly installed validator is a validator that is apparently running
   but marking anything as "invalid", without giving any error message as output.</p>

  <p>This is somewhat typical of a problem with OpenSP. Cross-check that you actually have a version
  above 1.5, by running <kbd>onsgmls --version</kbd>.</p>   


   <h4>The miracle debug options</h4>
   <p>If the validator is misbehaving, you can try forcing various debug options by appending to
   the URL the following string: <kbd>&amp;debug=1</kbd></p>

   <p>This can sometimes provide you with error messages that would not have appeared anywhere in
   non-debug mode, and can be helpful to diagnose the problem</p>

   <h4>If all fails...</h4>
   <p>Don't hesitate to contact the public mailing-list www-validator@w3.org with all the details 
  you can provide on what you did, tried, and what went wrong...</p>

    <h3 id="post-install">Post-install options</h3>
   <p>if the installation succeeded, you should be able to now use the Markup Validator on your own
   system and network. You may want to give the validator a look and feel specific to your Web site.
   The easiest way to achieve this is to edit <code>header.html</code> and <code>footer.html</code>
   (in the <code>htdocs</code> directory), the header and footer markup snippets used to build all 
   pages for the validator.</p><p>  You may also edit the Style Sheets (in the same directory), 
   especially <code>base.css</code> You may however want to avoid editing the other CSS files too 
   heavily, there is a risk you could make the output of the validator unusable.</p>
   <p>
     If you edit any *.css or *.js files, make sure that you update the gzipped
     versions of the edited files as well if they're installed and content
     negotiation for them is enabled in your setup (both are usually true if
     the validator was installed following these instructions).
