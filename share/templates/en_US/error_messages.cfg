    <ul>
      <li>putting text directly in the body of the document without wrapping

      <li>forgetting to quote an attribute value

      <li>using XHTML-style self-closing tags (such as &lt;meta ... /&gt;)
          in HTML 4.01 or earlier. To fix, remove the extra slash ('/')

      The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed.
      This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements -- such as a
      "style" element in the "body" section instead of inside "head" -- or
      two elements that overlap (which is not allowed).
    </p>
    <p>
      One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML
      documents. Due to HTML's rules of implicitly closed elements, this error
      can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTML's "self-closing"
      tags for "meta" and "link" in the "head" section of a HTML document may
      cause the parser to infer the end of the "head" section and the
      beginning of the "body" section (where "link" and "meta" are not
      allowed; hence the reported error).

      The Validator found an end tag for the above element, but that element is

      element that was removed during editing, or by an implicitly closed
      element (if you have an error related to an element being used where it

      An entity reference was found in the document, but there is no reference
      by that name defined. Often this is caused by misspelling the reference
      name, unencoded ampersands, or by leaving off the trailing semicolon (;).
      <strong>The most common cause of this error is unencoded ampersands in
      URLs</strong> as described by the <a

    </p>
    <p>
      Entity references start with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a
      semicolon (;). If you want to use a literal ampersand in your document
      you must encode it as "&amp;amp;" (<em>even inside URLs!</em>). Be
      careful to end entity references with a semicolon or your entity
      reference may get interpreted in connection with the following text.
      Also keep in mind that named entity references are case-sensitive;
      &amp;Aelig; and &amp;aelig; are different characters.

      <p>
        Many Document Types based on XML need a mandatory <code>xmlns</code> attribute on the root element. For example, the root element for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#strict">XHTML</a> might look like:<br />
        <code>&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;</code>
