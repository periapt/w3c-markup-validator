 Notes
 .
 This version:
 http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231
 .
 This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December
 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that
 this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the
 W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references
 to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the
 ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the
 previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software
 Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
 under the Open Source Definition.
