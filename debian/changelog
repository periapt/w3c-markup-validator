    the Debian XML/SGML group
  * Updated copyright
  * Fixed various broken dependencies including broadening apache2 dependency to
    include httpd-cgi (Closes: #627962). The reason for this

    resolved in a satisfactory manner.

  * Releasing to unstable 

 -- Nicholas Bamber <nicholas@periapt.co.uk>  Tue, 25 Jan 2011 22:42:59 +0000

w3c-markup-validator (1.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New maintainer rebuilt package from first principles (Closes: #573497)
  * Upgraded to upstream version 1.1 (Closes: #461021 and  Closes: #437795)
  * Restricting dependency to apache2 until someone volunteers to do
    integration for other web servers.
  * Changed dependency from w3c-dtd-xhtml and sgml-data to w3c-sgml-lib.
  * Basing apache config fragment on upstream supplied fragment. As a
    consequence of this the home page is http://localhost/w3c-validator/.
    (Closes: #456904).
  * Setting version dependency on libwww-perl after investigating taint issues
  * Replacing W3C placeholder logo with customized Debian logo.
  * Restricting support to http. This is a holding operation for #445265.
  * Reviewed and rewrote README.Debian (Closes: #549025).
  * Adding lintian override over inclusion of mootools convenience library.
  * Simplified install scripts as much as possible, though
    leaving some abstraction in case there is a need to add support for more
    webservers.
  * Removed dependency on wwwconfig-common.
  * Automatically enable mod_include and mod_rewrite before bouncing the
    server (Closes: #477792).
  * The simplified install scripts mean that translation is no longer
    required. In fact the translated text referred to old versions of Apache
    that are no longer part of Debian. (Closes: #551185).

  * README.Debian: Added note from Adam Sjøgren <asjo@koldfront.dk>
    (see bug 286091) about the use of check to validate pages that

    have not applied the patch yet, and have left the bug open for
    now.
