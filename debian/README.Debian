Configuration
=============
Almost certainly you will want to edit 
/etc/w3c/validator.conf to allow one to test webpages on the internal network.
However this is not enabled by default as a security precaution. Find this
line and change the "no" to "yes".

Allow Private IPs = no

The install scripts will enable the include and rewrite apache modules, however
the remove scripts will not disable these modules. This seems this safest
way of satisfying the code's dependencies on these modules.

Upgrading from older Debian packages
====================================
Although old config files will be preserved at the user's discretion
as per normal Debian policy, they are unlikely to work. The general reason
is that older packagings in Debian suffered from unnecessary divergence 
from upstream configuration and several versions have come and gone since 
then. As such backwards compatibility seems an unlikely goal.
The three specific issues that might be faced are:

 * In the file /etc/w3c/validator.conf file the Paths/SGML section is rather
   different.
 * The path to the main executable is now
   /usr/lib/cgi-bin/w3c-markup-validator/check.
 * The home page is now http://localhost/w3c-validator/.

Suggested post-installation tests
=================================
1.) Run /usr/lib/cgi-bin/w3c-markup-validator/check
This should return an HTML page complaining that that type of document is not
supported. It should not complain of syntax or configuration errors.
2.) If online run /usr/lib/cgi-bin/w3c-markup-validator/check 'uri=http://www.periapt.co.uk'.
This should return an HTML page confirming valid HTML.
3.) Point your browser at http://localhost/w3c-validator/ and run any tests you can think of.

Old note about authentication (Needs follow up)
=============================
Note from Adam Sj√∏gren <asjo@koldfront.dk> in Bug#298772:

[ Note from Nicholas Bamber <nicholas@periapt.co.uk>.
I have not had time to check this stuff out. 
However the patch is now out of date. "w3c-markup-validator" is now 
"w3c-validator/". ]

The Apache-configuration supplied by this package is insufficient for
validating pages that require http-authorization.

The "check" script attempts to proxy the auth-request (the browser
pops up a login/password dialogue), but fails (the dialogue keeps
appearing over and over despite correctly entered login/password).

The problem is that the script expects the environment variable
HTTP_AUTHORIZATION to contain the contents of the Authorization-header
(see line 1408 in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/check). It does not by default.

By searching a little I've found an easy way to set this using
mod_rewrite, as shown in this tiny patch:
